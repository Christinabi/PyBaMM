    "# \"2+1D\" Pouch Cell Model\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we show how you can use PyBaMM to solve a \"2+1D\" pouch cell model. By \"2+1D\" we mean that the pouch cell is modelled by considering a number of 1+1D (pseudo-two-dimensional) models for the through-cell electrochemical behaviour coupled via a 2D model for the electrical behaviour in the current collectors. We also include thermal effects in the model, under the assumption that the temperature is uniform across the cell thickness (which is small compared with the remaining two dimensions). This results in a 2D model the thermal behaviour of cell. The model is fully-coupled, in the sense that the electrochimical behaviour (inclduding the parameters) depends on the temperature."
