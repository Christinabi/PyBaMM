# [Unreleased](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM)

## Features

-   Generalized importing of external variables ([#728](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/728))
-   Separated active and inactive material volume fractions ([#726](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/726))
-   Added submodels for tortuosity ([#726](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/726))
-   Simplified the interface for setting current functions ([#723](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/723))
-   Added Heaviside operator ([#723](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/723))
-   Allow abs tolerance to be set by variable for IDA KLU solver ([#700](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/700))
-   New extrapolation methods ([#707](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/707))
-   Added Simulation class ([#693](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/693))
-   Added interface to CasADi solver ([#687](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/687), [#691](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/691), [#714](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/714)). This makes the SUNDIALS DAE solvers (Scikits and KLU) truly optional (though IDA KLU is recommended for solving the DFN).
-   Added option to use CasADi's Algorithmic Differentiation framework to calculate Jacobians ([#687](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/687))
-   Added method to evaluate parameters more easily ([#669](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/669))
-   Added `Jacobian` class to reuse known Jacobians of expressions ([#665](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/670))
-   Added `Interpolant` class to interpolate experimental data (e.g. OCP curves) ([#661](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/661))
-   Added interface (via pybind11) to sundials with the IDA KLU sparse linear solver ([#657](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/657))
-   Allowed parameters to be set by material or by specifying a particular paper ([#647](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/647))
-   Set relative and absolute tolerances independently in solvers ([#645](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/645))
-   Added basic method to allow (a part of) the State Vector to be updated with results obtained from another solution or package ([#624](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/624))
-   Added some non-uniform meshes in 1D and 2D ([#617](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/617))

## Optimizations

-   Use CasADi's automatic differentation algorithms by default when solving a model ([#714](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/714))
-   Avoid re-checking size when making a copy of an `Index` object ([#656](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/656))
-   Avoid recalculating `_evaluation_array` when making a copy of a `StateVector` object ([#653](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/653))

## Bug fixes

-   Improved flexibility of parameter values so that parameters (such as diffusivity or current) can be set as functions or scalars ([#723](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/723))
-   Fixed a bug where boundary conditions were sometimes handled incorrectly in 1+1D models ([#713](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/713))
-   Corrected a sign error in Dirichlet boundary conditions in the Finite Element Method ([#706](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/706))
-   Passed the correct dimensional temperature to open circuit potential ([#702](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/702))
-   Added missing temperature dependence in electrolyte and interface submodels ([#698](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/698))
-   Fixed differentiation of functions that have more than one argument ([#687](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/687))
-   Added warning if `ProcessedVariable` is called outside its interpolation range ([#681](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/681))
-   Improved the way `ProcessedVariable` objects are created in higher dimensions ([#581](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/581))
