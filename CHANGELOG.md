# [Unreleased](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM)

## Features

- Add method to evaluate parameters more easily (#669 )
- Add `Interpolant` class to interpolate experimental data (e.g. OCP curves) (#661 )
- Allow parameters to be set by material or by specifying a particular paper (#647 )
- Set relative and absolute tolerances independently in solvers (#645 )
- Add some non-uniform meshes in 1D and 2D (#617 )

## Optimizations

- Avoid re-checking size when making a copy of an `Index` object (#656 )
- Avoid recalculating `_evaluation_array` when making a copy of a `StateVector` object (#653 )

## Bug fixes

# [v0.1.0](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/tree/v0.1.0) - 2019-10-08

This is the first official version of PyBaMM.
Please note that PyBaMM in still under active development, and so the API may change in the future.
